1. Importing Required Libraries

2. Loading the Dataset

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

a. Understanding the dataset

Head of the dataset
Shape of the data set
Types of columns
Information about data set
Summary of the data set
b. Data Cleaning

Dropping duplicate values
Checking NULL values
Checking for 0 value
4. Data Visualization

Here we are going to plot :-
Count Plot :- to see if the dataset is balanced or not
Histograms :- to see if data is normally distributed or skewed
Box Plot :- to analyse the distribution and see the outliers
Scatter plots :- to understand relationship between any two variables
Pair plot :- to create scatter plot between all the variables
5. Feature Selection

6. Handling Outliers

7. Split the Data Frame into X and y

8. TRAIN TEST SPLIT

9. Build the Classification Algorithm

9.1 KNN

9.2 Naive Bayes

9.3 SVM

9.4 Decision Tree

9.5 Random Forest

9.6 Logistic Regression

The models include the following:-Â¶
a. Hyper Parameter Tuning using GridSearch CV

b. Fit Best Model

c. Predict on testing data using that model

d. Performance Metrics :- Confusion Matrix, F1 Score, Precision Score, Recall Score
Also performed oversampling too manage the imbalance data in my  target.
